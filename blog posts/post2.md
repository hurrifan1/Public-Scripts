### First off...

...I am trying to do as much of this stuff as I can solo. By "stuff" I not only mean how to code, but also how to make it as easy as possible for me to ultimately succeed. I'll consider myself successful if I can eventually design and develop a fully-functioning project. Not even anything big, but ideally something fun and indicative of my newfound skills.

With that being said, my goal as far as finding the right tools for learning Python, R, and Ruby has been to minimize the amount of software I download. I don't want to distract myself with too many shiny things, so to speak, so I looked for highly rated do-it-all IDEs to utilize. This lead me to several options, including Atom, RStudio, Jupyter Notebook, Spyder, and of course Visual Studio.

#### Atom
I really liked the feel of Atom, but after writing some test Python, I couldn't figure out how to run it in! I tried to add in the Hydrogen package to run it but even that, I couldn't get that to run, either. I think it's because it needed me to link it to a remote kernel or something but that seemed like a lot of work.

#### RStudio
I was introduced to RStudio through one of my university classes, Big Data Analytics. I've been using RStudio to write R code for class but have also been experimenting with my own data. I'm planning on writing a blog post at some point about my analysis of my Netflix data  because it's been the first attempt at data analysis in a coding sense (*Spoiler Alert*: it's a lottttttt of Always Sunny in Philadelphia). RStudio is also what I learned Markdown with, which I've grown to love since so many websites and other programs use it (like Codepen!). I've already become very familiar with this program and will enjoy using it through the end of my class and beyond.

These next few IDEs were accessed through the **Anaconda Navigator** program. I was attracted to Anaconda because it's tailored towards data science developing tools and IDEs, which are what I am hoping to use in a business environment in the future.

#### Jupyter Notebook
Jupyter was the first IDE in Anaconda Navigator that I tested out. It was very lightweight, which was expected, but was really fun to use! I actually prefer Jupyter's style of cell management better than RStudio's, where Jupyter has small breaks between its cells but RStudio is a running document if writing Markdown. While Jupyter Notebook had an enjoyably minimal layout, I would have liked to have customized its look a little more to spruce up the editor view. Just a preference thing as far as colors and such, not a big issue. I think my favorite part of using this program is that it runs in my browser â€“ so convenient! Love this IDE.

#### Spyder
The first time I used Spyder was when I used it to check some Python I was writing for my Udacity course. From the moment I opened the program, it was extremely easy to use and helped me solve my coding issue quickly. Admittedly, I need to spend a little bit more time with the program before I can say definitively whether or not it will be a major asset to me in the future. However, I have very high hopes for it!

#### Visual Studio
My basic understanding, though rooted only in knowing the clout of the company behind the product, is that this product is one of the best IDE products available. It can tackle all the most popular coding languages and with lots of ways to customize the experience. As with Spyder, I haven't had a chance to really dive into this program yet, but I'm looking forward to seeing what it has to offer. I'm excited to run a few test scripts through it and see what happens!

### So...
After all is said and done, I can't truly decide which IDE to stick with as I continue to learn and experiment with R, Python, and Ruby. However, I'm as excited as ever to keep using each one to find out which one will give me the most freedom to explore.

Until I figure it out, I've got a lot more learning to do!
